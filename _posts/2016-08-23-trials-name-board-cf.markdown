In my previous [post](https://mongerrr.github.io/2016-07-24-trials-name-board-printing/), I wrote about my results from 3D printing my [trials name board](https://mongerrr.github.io/2016-07-16-trials-name-board/) in two common materials, which were ABS and PLA plastics. I also mentioned that I was keen to try some more exotic materials. Since then, I have been keeping an eye out for anyone who could do something like this for a reasonable price. I managed to find a hub on [3D Hubs](https://www.3dhubs.com) that would print me the name board in Carbon Fibre Reinforced PLA.

Some of the the other materials I spotted while looking for this were;
- Carbon fibre reinforced nylon
  - Stronger than CFRPLA, but a ton more expensive too
- SLS Nylon
  - Also hugely expensive
- Hard Elastomer
  - Would be able to take any impact the bike could take, but I'm not sure how well a body panel would look in a rubber like material
- There were other materials that I found, but some of them were unsuitable for a bike due to UV degradation

The print that I got in CFRPLA was a lot stronger than either of the previous prints and still had a fair amount of flex in it. The person printing the piece had a failed print which he was kind enough to give me for free, so I had a spare part to play around with to get an idea of just how strong the part was. I am more than confident that the piece will survive my gumby riding.

This print was done with 100 micron layers, although in person, it seems a lot more accurate than the ABS print I got done in 100 micron layers. This may be in part due to the high rigidity of the material and also due to the low shrinkage during setting compared to ABS. The layer lines are very uniform and stand out visually, even though the surface is relatively smooth. Personally, I think that the uniform striation pattern adds to the aesthetic of the print and I won't be sanding the surface of this print.

All in all, I would have to say that I am very impressed with the print in carbon fibre reinforced PLA and would highly recommend it for anyone willing to spend an extra $10-20 over a more common material.  Again, let me know in the comments about any experiences you have had with other materials

Here some pictures of the print. I'll be sure to update this post with some pictures of the part on my bike.
