For those of you who have seen [trials name board](http://mongerrr.github.io) and would like to 3D print for your own bike, here are some tips that I can share from 3D printing my own parts.

**3D Printing Providers**

Commercial 3D printers are _expensive_, there is no other way of putting it. A good alternative that I have found was a site called [3D Hubs](hhtps://3dhubs), which can offer a reasonably good print for a good price. What 3D Hubs does, is let people (both hobbyists and commercial) who own a 3D printer list their printer on their site, so instead of having downtime, it can be used to produce other peoples prints. On a side note, 3D Hubs also operates worldwide, as I have noticed there has been some international readers

Since a lot of these people are enthusiasts rather than commercial 3D printers, it means that the prints can be done a lot cheaper than at a commercial outfit. The website also makes it easy to find the best price for the materials you want without the hassle of chasing down dozens of quotes.

I would like to one day have my own 3D printing set up at home, but until then, I will be using 3D hubs.

**Material Selection**

3D printing allows for a wide selection of materials which can start to get a bit hard to keep up with. So far, I have done prints in both PLA and ABS plastics, which are common 3D printing materials, with ABS also being a common motorcycle body panel material.

Between the two, I would say that ABS is the better material, as long as you are willing to put some time into cleaning it up afterwards. PLA is an easy to print material, so there may be more people willing to print for you, but overall, it is more brittle and weaker than a treated ABS piece. The only way to remove any imperfections or layer marks on a PLA piece is to use sandpaper.

An ABS piece is relatively strong in the plane of each layer, but it need some treatment to get strength perpendicular to the layers. The easiest way to do this is to use acetone, which is easy to get at pharmacies or even some hardware stores.

The acetone chemically melts the layers together, which adds both strength and flexibility to the piece. Since it also dissolves ABS, it can also be used to smooth out the layer lines and give the piece more of a glossy look.

There are still many more materials that can be 3D printed and if anyone has any comments they can give on other materials, I would be glad to hear them. I would like to get this board printed in polycarbonate in the future as well, and carbon fibre printing is intriguing if I ever find someone who could do it without it costing a fortune. When I try other materials, I will be sure to update this article.

**3D Printing Techniques**

There are a huge number of ways to 3D print the same object in the same material. The two main parameters I will focus on here though, are the layer height and one piece vs multiple piece techniques for printing.

In 3D printing the layer height is very important in determining the print time, accuracy and cost. In the two prints I have gotten so far, I deliberately picked for one print to have 100 micron layers and the other to have 200 micron layers, to do a comparison. I found the 200 micron to have noticeable striations (layer marks) and some instances where the print started to fold on itself. Another important consideration was the printing tolerances. Thinner layers, mean tighter tolerances, which was noticeable on the scorecard bar, where a small deviation on either side in the 200 micron print resulted in a decent change in thickness.

The 100 micron print had acceptably small striations and much better tolerances. I would recommend going 125 micron or less. The smaller the layer height, the more expensive the print gets, so a good compromise would be the 100-125 micron mark. Also, when dealing with very small layer sizes, like <75 microns, there starts to become less and less people with machines able to do the print, so that is another consideration.

When getting my parts printed, I also wanted to test the finished result compared between getting the part printed in one piece, vs getting the part printed in 2 pieces and then stuck together later. Obviously, having 2 pieces only really lends itself well to materials like ABS. On my 2 piece ABS print, I was able to use some of the excess support materials dissolved in acetone, to stitch the two parts together. The seam ended up being one of the strongest parts of the plate since the layers were completely bound together at the seam from me building it up with the ABS-acetone mixture.

While 1 piece is more desirable, being able to print in 2 pieces opens up a wider range of 3D printers that are able to do the job.

**Pictures of My Prints**

Here some pictures of the two prints that I have done so far.
These are pictures of a piece made from ABS in 2 parts, with 100 micron layers.

**Conclusions**

So far, out of my prints with common materials, I would say to get a one piece ABS print, with layers of 100 microns or less. I would also suggest to paint it with acetone afterwards, to improve strength, and flexibility.

Let me know in the comments about any experiences you have had with different layer heights or more exotic materials
