I've decided to open this blog to share my designs for 3d printed motorbike parts. Initially, I will be focussing on trials bikes, but in the future I would like to expand to include road bikes, and enduro/mx bikes.

***Why OpenMoto?***

When designing my trials bike name board, I looked into the costs associated with getting the piece manufactured on a small scale, due to interest in my design from the trials community. I found that even when vacuum casting, I couldn't get the final price down to my target price of AU$35. Using vacuum casting, the closest I could get was $80 if manufactured in Australia and $45 if manufactured in China. To get those prices, I had to assume that I was getting over 100 units vacuum cast, and to have a smaller amount, like 50 units, would cost significantly higher.

I decided against using this option as I felt it asked for too much money from the people interested in the part, and required me to keep an amount of inventory that I felt could be too much for the smaller Australian trials community. I decided to look into other options for my parts, which led me to come up with this "OpenMoto" idea.

***Basically, my designs will be free***.

I have to decided to go down the open hardware route for my parts. This means that my designs will be freely available, for people to download, 3d print or CNC, and critique. As well as the final 3d model, I will also supply the source code, so that if you think you could make changes to the design, you can experiment with them and make your own changes to my model.

If you feel your changes deserve their spot in the public domain, you are free to publish them, crediting me as the original designer, or you can contact me, and I can merge the changes into my design, and credit your contribution to the project.

I will be protecting my designs using the [TAPR Open Hardware License](Tapr.org), so that my designs remain free and credited to me. Under this license, any designs based on mine, are to remain free as well. I also encourage anyone who thinks they have the next great idea, to contact me, so that I can post about your designs as well and collaborate with you.

If you appreciate my designs and would like to fund my future designs, I would greatly appreciate if you [made a donation](https://paypal.me/mongerrr).

***What if I just want the parts, without the hassles?***

I also understand that there are people who don't want to muck around with stl's and codes and the like, and just want to receive a part that they can put on their bike. I get that, so I have decided to give everyone the option to have me to organise 3D printing for a small fee. This will vary by the individual part, and will be included in the post about that part.

To make things easier for people organising 3d printing for themselves, I will make sure that I make a post, giving some recommendations about materials and people who can 3d print parts for you. This will give more flexibility in terms of cost and materials, compared to volume production.
