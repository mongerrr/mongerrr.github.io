For my first design, I have made a front name board for trials bikes. The design would also look good on any pit bike too.

**Design Features**
- Easy mounting to the forks using cable ties
- Shape of the board allows for the use of preprinted 2016 Honda CRF50 graphics
- The back of the board includes a loop for a pen, and a small bar to clip a scorecard to, for club trials

**Design Process**

As this was my first design, I decided learn about some different design techniques. I started with a plastic mockup which had the general shape that I wanted, but did not have any of the cable tie guides, pen loop and bar on the back. The next step form here was to get the mockup 3D scanned, to get an early model. For this, I got the help of James Tawadros at the UTS 3D lab, who was great to deal with and I would recommend him for anyone who wants to do something similar.

Once I had this model, I began to manipulate the shape slightly, and add the mounting points, the pen loop and the scorecard bar. The software I used for this was [Openscad](http://www.openscad.org/), which allows for modelling the the pieces parametrically. Once the model was finished, I exported the design as a .stl file and then used [Meshlab](http://meshlab.sourceforge.net/) to remove any internal edges where components off the model intersected. The final .stl produced with Meshlab is ready for 3D printing.

**Design Issues**

When designing this part, I looked to the community for ideas and feedback. This raised some good ideas, and also some things for me to look into. The idea of having a pen loop and scorecard bar, was one of the suggestion made by the [trials community](http://www.trials.com.au), which I thought was a great idea.

The main issue that was raised by the community was concerns over the use of such a part with Motorcycling Australia's General Competition Rules. I was quite sure that the part would be sufficient to meet the GCR requirements, and to remove any doubt
