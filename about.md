I have to decided to go down the open hardware route for my parts. This means that my designs will be freely available, for people to download, 3d print or CNC, and critique. As well as the final 3d model, I will also supply the source code, so that if you think you could make changes to the design, you can experiment with them and make your own changes to my model.

If you feel your changes deserve their spot in the public domain, you are free to publish them, crediting me as the original designer, or you can contact me, and I can merge the changes into my design, and credit your contribution to the project.

I will be protecting my designs using the TAPR Open Hardware License, so that my designs remain free and credited to me. Under this license, any designs based on mine, are to remain free as well. I also encourage anyone who thinks they have the next great idea, to contact me, so that I can post about your designs as well and collaborate with you.

If you appreciate my designs and would like to fund my future designs, I would greatly appreciate if you made a donation.
